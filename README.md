# ChatGPT Final Project

My final project for UT Austin Cybersecurity bootcamp. 

# Goal of the Project 

This project was in a conference-style format. I conducted research, did hands-on analysis with ChatGPT, created a presentation, then presented to the other students. 

The primary goal of this project was to delve into AI "jailbreaks" in which carefully crafted input can cause ChatGPT to generate unfiltered responses. 

The project largely consisted of studying ChatGPT and its process, from start to finish. I learned how language learning models function as well as the function of an AI neural network. This allowed me to narrow down where these issues may be occuring within the process. Once I generated a solid hypothesis, I was able to understand risks associated with language learning models and provide educated mitigation strategies for them. 

# First Section 

For the first section of my presentation, I defined ChatGPT, jailbreaking, and gave an in-depth overview of my research methodology. 

# Second Section  

For the second section, I discussed the risks of jailbreaking, the DAN (Do-Anything-Now) Jailbreak, and then demonstrated the DAN jailbreak by crafting phishing email prompts. 

# Third Section 

For the final section, I reviewed the demonstrations in-depth, the process behind it, and my theory on where the errors might be occuring. Finally, I provided mitigation strategies for these issues. 

# Presentation
